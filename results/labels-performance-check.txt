Labels for performance evaluation
----------------------------------

phase 1 is before the aggregation along the smart meters
phase 2 is the aggregation along the smart meters

SM COUNT: 50/100/200/400
PRIVACY TYPE: Possible values: mask or encr
P: probability of failure
Terminated: did the algorithm terminate? Possible values: 1 or 0. Should be always 1.
Success: did the algorithm provide an aggregate (nmin)? Possible values:  1 or 0
TOTAL DC TIME: total computation time of the DC float
PHASE 1 DC TIME: total computation time of the DC in phase 1
MAX TOTAL SM TIME : maximum total computation time of a smart meter in one simulation
PHASE 1 COUNT: number of rounds in phase 1
PHASE 2 COUNT: number of rounds in phase 2
DC NET SND: number of messages that the DC sends in one simulation
DC NET RCV: number of messages that the DC receives in one simulation
MAX SM NET SND: maximum number of messages that a smart meter sends in one simulation
MAX SM NET RCV: maximum number of messages that a smart meter receives in one simulation
