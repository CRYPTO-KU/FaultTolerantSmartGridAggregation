Labels for performance evaluation
----------------------------------
    Each row represents one run of one configuration / setting.
    Different rows with the same configuration will have different link failures, but they were randomly selected with the same probability.

phase 1 is the part before the aggregation along the smart meters
phase 2 is the aggregation along the smart meters

SM COUNT: 50/100/200/400
PRIVACY TYPE: Possible values: mask or encr. Mask for masking, and encr for homomorphic encryption
P: probability of failure  for each link.
Terminated: 1 if terminated successfully (aggregate not necessarily obtained), 0 otherwise.
Success: 1 if aggregate obtained, 0 otherwise.
TOTAL DC TIME: Total time from round start till round end on the DC.
PHASE 1 DC TIME: Total time from round start till phase 1 end on the DC. We can get the time of phase 2 by (TOTAL DC TIME - PHASE 1 DC TIME).
MAX TOTAL SM TIME :The maximum total time took by one of the SMs (from round start to end).
PHASE 1 COUNT: Number of smart meters who sent data to DC in phase 1.
PHASE 2 COUNT: Number of smart meters who were in L_ACT in the end of the round.
DC NET SND: The number of bytes sent by DC in the round (not number of messages).
DC NET RCV: The number of bytes received by DC in the round.
MAX SM NET SND: Max bytes sent by an SM in that round.
MAX SM NET RCV: Max bytes received by an SM in that round.
